          I'm a lawyer learning to code, and I'm really excited about getting my
          first job in tech!

        <h2>🚂 What I do now 🚃🚃🚃</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently practicing as a lawyer working in-house on large scale
          rail infrastructure projects. It's been a great ten years, but I think
          it's time for a change!
        </p>
        <h2>Why I want to get into tech</h2>
        <p>
          I've always had a passion for computing, so a couple of years ago I
          decided to give coding a try and quickly fell in love with it. I
          really enjoy problem solving and I feel like coding takes the bits I
          like about the law and dials it up to 11.
        </p>
        <h2>What I've learnt so far</h2>
        <p>
          I've played around with vanilla JS/HTML/CSS. I've built a product
          rental website with a booking system, item creation and more using the
          MERN stack. And I've dabbled in some cardano development. I've learnt
          about making and using APIs, SQL and noSQL schemas, rails and sails,
          and a whole lot more!
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing the le wagon bootcamp gave me a really solid understanding of
          how software development works in the real world, and gave me the
          skills to work with whatever frameworks my future employer uses.
